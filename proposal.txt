CS102 - Final Project Proposal
Evan Minor and Joshua Swick

a. Brief Write-Up
The purpose of this project is to create an application that will gather data on the weather forcast, and print it out to a file.
The file will display readable data to the user based on the location the individual wants, as well as the on the day the individual wants.

b. Which topic, minimum of 3
This project will include nested loops, reading and witing to files, arrays, as well as many other aspects we have learned in class.

c. Pseudocode
Create the weather class
  Create the main method
  initiate the scanner
    
    while(true)
      create location string
      create date string


      ask user for a location input
      ask user for date input






      for loop for first dimension of the array
        for loop for second dimension of the array
          array[i][j] = weather output

      Ask the user if they would like to print the array to a file

      if statement if the user does wish to print to a file
      forloop to initatie print
        second forloop for the other half of the array
          array print statement
      if user does not wish to print the file
        continue

      Ask the user if they would like to restart the program for a different weather location and date
      if yes
        loop back to the beginning of the statement
      if no
        end program
